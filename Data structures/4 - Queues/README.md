# Queues

- Queues are used in a lot of situations. Basically, anywhere you want to proccess jobs in the order that you receive them.

- First-in-first-out (FIFO)

- When we have a resource, and this resource needs to be be shared by many consumers, we use queues. Basically, the consumers line up and share the resource one by one. (Printers, Operating systems, Web Servers, Live support systems)

# Operations

## Enqueue

## Dequeue
- For removing the the item at the front 

## Peek
- Get the item at the front without remove it

# Priority Queues
- Objects are processed based on their priority not in the order they joined the queue.
