# Data structures 

* LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
    - The data items are arranged in an orderly manner where the elements are attached adjacently.
    - The data elements can be accessed in one time (single run).
    - Array, queue, stack, linked list, etc.
    - Ineffective memory utilization.

* NON-LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES
    - It arranges the data hierarchically (or sorted) and there exists a relationship between the data elements.
    - Traversing of data elements in one go is not possible.
    - Tree and graph.
    - Effective memory utilization.
